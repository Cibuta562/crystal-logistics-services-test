Individual transport Orders enter into force from the date of acceptance without reservations of the offer and expire upon payment of the transport consideration. If within one hour from receiving the transport offer the Client does not announce an express refusal communicated in writing regarding the execution of the order, the transport order is considered validly concluded from the date the offer was sent.",

If the total value of the goods exceeds the insured value of the means of transport, the Client may request the Forwarding Company (i) to raise the liability limit of the means of transport insurance up to the value of the goods or (ii) to conclude cargo all risks insurance. Both ancillary services shall be negotiated by addendum and require payment of an additional fee.",

Pledge and Retention Right: The Carrier acts as an agent of CLS in exercising the right of pledge and retention over the goods if CLS’s Final Customer does not pay the transport price. The Carrier is obliged to strictly follow CLS’s instructions regarding parking of the truck or unloading the goods in a warehouse indicated by CLS. Unloading the goods without CLS’s written consent, in situations where such consent is required, entails a penalty of 100% of the transport cost, the Carrier being directly liable for the damages caused by releasing the goods.",
            "8.2. Force Majeure: Neither Party shall be liable for failure to fulfil its contractual obligations if such failure is due to a force majeure event, unforeseeable and unavoidable. The Party invoking force majeure must notify the other Party as soon as possible.",
            "8.3. Confidentiality and Prohibition to Contact Customers:\n   a) Confidentiality: The Carrier undertakes to treat as strictly confidential all commercial information of which it becomes aware (prices, customers, routes, etc.) and not to disclose it to third parties.\n   b) Prohibition to Contact the Final Customer: It is strictly forbidden to contact directly or indirectly CLS’s Final Customer, as well as to enter into any direct agreement with them. Breach of this clause is penalised with a fixed amount of 50,000 EUR, as liquidated damages.\n   c) Unfair Competition: If, following the breach of this clause, the Carrier starts working directly with CLS’s Final Customer, the Carrier shall additionally owe penalties of 25% of the value of all transports performed with that customer.\n",
            "8.4. Assignment and Subcontracting: Assignment or subcontracting of transport services is strictly prohibited without the prior written consent of CLS. Breach of this obligation entails a fixed penalty of 2,000 EUR per case, without prejudice to CLS’s right to claim additional damages.",
            "8.5. Additional Penalty Clauses:\n   a) Defamation and Threats: Any insults, threats or defamatory statements made against CLS (including online) may lead to penalties for moral damages of up to 50,000 EUR.\n   b) Blackmail: Conditioning the delivery of the goods on an advance payment not agreed contractually is deemed blackmail and is penalised with 10,000 EUR.\n",
