            "2.5. The Forwarding Contract (framework contract) enters into force on the date of its signing. Individual transport orders enter into force from the date of unreserved acceptance of the offer and expire upon payment of the transport value. If, within one hour of receiving the transport offer by the Client, no express written refusal regarding the execution of the order is announced, the transport order is considered validly concluded from the date the offer was sent.",

Due to general conditions on the transport market, the loading date and the unloading date are estimated, and these dates may change depending on the specific factual situation encountered during the transport, such as additional conditionalities or diversions of the means of transport on certain road segments, traffic blockages, stops at other loading/delivery points, unfavorable weather conditions, routine checks on the means of transport, etc., and the Client understands that these changes in loading/unloading dates do not represent the fault of the Forwarding Company.",
            "2.9. During transport, the value of the goods is insured according to the insurance of the means of transport used. If the total value of the goods exceeds the insured value of the means of transport, the Client may request the Forwarding Company to (i) raise the liability limit of the transport means insurance up to the value of the goods or (ii) conclude an all-risks cargo insurance. Both accessory services will be negotiated by supplementary act and require payment of an additional fee.",

Due to general conditions on the transport market, in cases where transport provision costs increase (for example, due to road tolls, fuel costs, inflation on the transport market, etc.), the Forwarding Company will notify the updated price within 15 days before the execution of the next transport order, and the forwarding contract continues only after the Client accepts the new price; otherwise, it terminates by operation of law."

If the agreed payment deadline is after loading or coincides with the time of unloading (0 days from unloading), the Beneficiary is obliged to make the full payment before starting the unloading operation of the goods from the means of transport. The truck will stand for 30 minutes for the collection of the transport value. The Forwarding Company has the right not to unload the goods and to charge a fee of 50 EUR/hour for parking until the full payment of the contract price. Failure to pay the forwarding contract price on time and the parking of the means of transport at the unloading location / storage of the goods generates supplementary costs to the Client according to art. 8.3. below.",

The Client is in contractual relations exclusively with the Forwarding Company, not with its subcontractors (such as carriers), so the price of the forwarding contract will be considered paid only if it is paid into the Forwarding Company's account. In exceptional cases where payment of the contract price is only possible in cash, the Client will pay the contract value to the carrier exclusively with the written consent of the Forwarding Company. If the Client proceeds to pay the contract price in cash to subcontractors without the Forwarding Company's consent or without requesting a receipt upon payment, the payment will not be taken into account and will not be enforceable against the Forwarding Company.",

Failure to pay the value of the service provided by the Forwarding Company on time incurs late penalties of 1% of the contract price for each day of delay, penalties calculated from the date of sending the invoice by CLS via e-mail, until the date of full payment. Late penalties calculated from the due date until the actual payment date may exceed the amount of the debt owed.",

During the term of the forwarding contract, the Forwarding Company undertakes to honor every individual transport order sent by the Client in a timely manner and to respect the price provided in the Forwarding Contract or, if the price is left to free bidding, to offer the most competitive prices for its Client. For this service, the Client cannot request offers or conclude transport orders with other suppliers regarding the transports covered by this contract, except when the Forwarding Company fails, for exceptional reasons, to honor that order.",

If the Client was forced to conclude a single transport order covered by the contract with another similar service provider due to the fault of the Forwarding Company according to art. 7.2. above, the latter undertakes to compensate the Client with the price difference actually paid by the Client to the third-party provider and the price that the Forwarding Company would have offered according to the Forwarding Contract, up to a limit of 500.00 Euro.",

The Forwarding Contract may be terminated for non-performance/improper performance by sending a written notification to this effect by the entitled party, the contract ceasing within 30 calendar days from the date of sending the notification, unless, within this period, the defaulting party performs/remedies the services. Termination/resiliation/cessation of the contract for any reason does not affect orders already executed or in progress, and these will be carried out according to the contract.",

The Client cannot initiate negotiations/conclude transport contracts directly with CLS subcontractors, under the penalty of the forwarding contract terminating by operation of law and the payment of damages conventionally set at the amount of 25,000 Euro, representing CLS's unrealized profit from all intermediations that could have been carried out under this contract."

All costs arising in connection with the exercise of the right of retention/lien, including, but not limited to: storage costs, handling, vehicle redirection, parking time, will be borne by the Client, and the compensation value for the supported costs shall be paid before the goods are unloaded and presented to the consignee.",
            "8.3. The right of retention until the payment of the above costs is exercised after the free unloading time has elapsed or in case of express refusal / lack of a response regarding the payment of the forwarding contract price, depending on the most feasible option, by (i) parking the means of transport at the loading/unloading location, the Client owing 500 EUR/day of parking or (ii) storing the goods in a warehouse chosen by the Forwarding Company, the Client owing 90 EUR+VAT/ton/day of storage, including storage and handling costs of the goods or (iii) by any other reasonable manner, including the sale or destruction of the goods.",
            "8.4. CLS may, at any time, exercise its right of retention/lien over the goods and accompanying documents, as security for the payment of any other sum owed in accordance with the order, including the costs of recovering it. This right of retention/lien may be exercised not only for the absence of payment in connection with the service in question but may also be extended to any existing obligations, at any time, including within other contracts. If the parties conclude several successive forwarding/transport contracts, these are considered services forming part of a framework forwarding/transport contract with that specific Client, respecting the contractual conditions agreed upon through the first forwarding/transport contract and supplemented by those negotiated by the parties through correspondence.
